# sklearn_guide

A Jupyter Notebook showing some of the more powerful and nontrivial uses of the Scikit-learn (version 0.23+), XGBoost, and Keras (with Tensorflow backend) Python APIs, as well as key-fact introductions, tutorials, and usage tips of common machine learning algorithms.

I generally follow along with the book "Hands-On Machine Learning" (title abbreviated by me) 2nd ed., by Geron, but fill in many details, for instance from the  [sklearn userguide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) papers from the algorithms' original authors.
