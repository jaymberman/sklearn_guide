# sklearn_guide

A Jupyter Notebook showing some of the more powerful and nontrivial uses of the Scikit-learn (version 0.23+) and XGBoost Python machine learning frameworks, as well as mathematically mature (if only semi-rigorous) introductions, tutorials, and usage tips of classic machine learning algorithms, including linear models, SVMs & kernel methods, decision trees, bagging e.g. random forests, boosting e.g. XGBoost, stacking, manifold learning and visualization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, outlier detection, and more. Also discussed are common preprocessing steps e.g. standardization/normalization, null value handling, categorical encoding, defining pipelines, and more. 

I generally follow along with the book "Hands-On Machine Learning" (title abbreviated by me) 2nd ed., by Geron, but fill in many, many details regarding complexity, right-tool-for-the-job discussions, and other misc. details from the  [sklearn userguide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), papers from the algorithms' original authors, etc..

This can be treated as a detailed reference for machine learning using the sklearn framework.
